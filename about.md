Climate change exacerbates and increases the incidence of extreme heat events. According to NOAA, extreme heat consistently leads to the deadliest outcomes of all weather events annually. Understanding how heat impacts our communities is becoming increasingly necessary.

The campaign is partnering with CAPA Strategies, a company that facilitates heat mapping campaigns like this all over the world, alongside the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The data collected will be compiled and analyzed to help city officials better understand the underlying disparities in access to green and cool spaces.
