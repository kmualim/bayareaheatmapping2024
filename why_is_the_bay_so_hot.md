# Urban Heat Island Effect ## 

### Extreme heat intensifies in developed areas with many buildings and roads, but few trees or green spaces. In these areas, heat gets stored by unshaded concrete and asphalt, which then radiate heat back into the air and cause the temperatures to be 15°F to 20°F warmer in "urban heat islands." ###

California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment Report for the San Francisco Bay Area Region, released in 2018, found that between 1950 and 2005, the average annual maximum temperature increased by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
